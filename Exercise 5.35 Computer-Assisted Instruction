//Exercise 5.35 Computer-Assisted Instruction
/* The use of computers in education is referred to as 
computer ¬assisted instruction (CAI). Write a program 
that will help an elementary school student learn 
multiplication. Use a Random object to produce 2 positive 
1-digit integers. The program will then prompt the user 
with a question, such as “How much is 6 times 7?”

The student then inputs the answer. Next, the program 
checks the student’s answer. If it is correct, display 
the message “Very Good!” and ask another multiple question.
If the answer is wrong, display the message “No. Please try again.” 
And let the student try the same question repeatedly until 
the student finally gets it right. A separate method will 
be used to generate each new question. This method will be 
called once when the application begins execution and each
time the user answers the question correctly. */
